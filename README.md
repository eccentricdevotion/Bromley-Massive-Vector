##Alternate installation and keeping up-to-date

As the TARDIS resource packs are shared in GitHub repositories. If you install a GitHub client, you can easily keep your resource packs current by syncing with any changes that are pushed to the repository.

Here's a quick run down on doing that:

1. Download and install the GitHub client for your operating system:
   * [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)
   * [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
2. Start GitHub client and create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
3. In your web browser, navigate to the TARDIS resource pack repositories

   * [Bromley Massive Vector](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/Bromley-Massive-Vector)
4. Click the Clone in Desktop button
5. Save the repository clone in the minecraft/resourcepacks folder
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each resource pack
